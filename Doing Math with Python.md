# 01 Working with Numbers

Within this chapter:

- you learn to write programs that recognize integers, floating point numbers, fractional numbers (expressed as a fraction or a floating point number), and complex numbers.
- you write programs that generate multiplication tables, perform unit conversions, and find the roots of a quadratic equation


## 01-01 Basic Mathematical Operations

### addition (+)

### subtraction (-)

### multiplication (*)

### division (/)

#### floor division (//)

#### modulo (%)

### exponential (**)

#### square root: x ** (1/2)

#### cube root: x ** (1/3)

### Python will evaluate the expression following the standard PEMDAS rule for the order of calculations

#### PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplications, division, addition, subtraction

## 01-02 Labels: Attaching Names to Numbers

## 01-03 Different Kinds of Numbers

### Data Type

#### Use type() to check the kind of number (or variable)

#### int(), float(), etc.. used to convert the data type

### 01-03-01 Working with Fractions

#### from fractions import Fraction

#### <class 'fractions.Fraction'>

#### Fraction(a,b) or Fraction(a/b) ==>
Fraction(numerator, denominator)

### 01-03-02 Complex Numbers

#### <class 'complex'>: a+bj

# 02 Visualizing Data with Graphs

In this chapter, you'll learn a powerful way to present numerical data: by drawing graphs with Python.

- We'll start by discussing the number line and the Cartesian plane.
- Next, we'll learn about the powerful plotting librarymatplotlib and how we can use it to create graphs.
- We'll then explore how to make graphs that present data clearly and intuitively.
- Finally, we'll use graphs to explore Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and projectile motion.

# 03 Describing Data with Statistics

In this chapter:

- We'll use Python to explore statistics so we can study, describe, and better understand sets of data.
- After looking at some basic statistical measures -- the mean, median, mode, and range -- we'll move on to some more advanced measures, such as variance and standard deviation
- We'll see how to calculate the correlation coefficient, which allows you to quantify the relationship between two sets of data
- We'll end the chapter by learning about scatter plots.
- We'll learn more about the Python language and standard library modules.


## 03-01 Finding the Mean

### The "average" number; found by adding all data points and dividing by the number of data points
 
It's best to use themean  to describe the center of a dataset when the distribution is mostly symmetrical and there are no outliers


### 03-01_finding-mean.py

## 03-02 Finding the Median

### The middle number; found by ordering all data points and picking out the one in the middle (or if there are two middle numbers, taking the mean of those two numbers)

### It's best to use the median when the distribution is either skewed or there are outliers present

### 03-02_finding-median.py

## 03-03 Finding the Mode and Creating a Frequency Table

### 03-03-01 Finding the Most Common Elements

#### Count how many times each unique number occurs and find the one that occurs the most.

#### from collections import Counter
Counter(list).most_common()
mode = Counter(list).most_common(1)

#### 03-03_1_fining-most-common-elements.py

#### 03-03_4_frequency-table.py

#### 03-03_5_frequency-table-sorted.py

## 03-04 Measuring the Dispersion (分散)

Thedispersion tells us how far away the numbers int he set of data are from the mean of the data set.


### 03-04-01 Finding the Range of a Set of Numbers
 
For a list of numbers, therange  is the difference between the highest number and the lowest number


#### You could have two groups of numbers with the exact same mean but with vastly different ranges, so knowing the range fills in more information about a set of numbers
 (see:03-01 Finding the Mean)
#### 03-04_1_finding-range.py

### 03-04-20 Finding the Variance and Standard Deviation
 
Thevariance is the average of the squares of those differences of each of the numbers from themean.

 (see:Standard Deviation is the square root of the variance)
##### A high variance means that values are far from the mean.

##### A low variance means that the values are clustered close to the mean.

#### Standard Deviation is the square root of the variance

##### Values that are within ONE standard deviation of the mean can be thought of as fairly typical.
 
Values that are THREE or MORE standard deviations away from the mean can be considered much more atypical -- we call such valuesoutliers

 (see:It's best to use the median when the distribution is either skewed or there are outliers present)
#### 03-04_2_finding-variance-sd.py

## 03-05 Calculating the Correlation Between Two Data Sets

In this section, we'll learn how to calculate a statistical measure that tells usthe nature and strength of the relationship between two sets of numbers: thePearson Correlation Coefficient.

This coefficient measures the strength of thelinear relationship.

The coefficient can be either positive or negative, and its magnitude can range between -1 and 1 (inclusive).

# 04 Algebra and Symbolic Math with Sympy

We learn how to write programs that can solve symbolic math problems.

We will use SymPy - a Python library that lets you write expressions containing symbols and perform operations on them.


## 04-00 Installing SymPy

### Prerequisite: pip3 install mpmath

### pip3 install sympy

#### Verify of Installation: from sympy import *

### Usage

#### import sys
import mpmath
from sympy import *

### Testing

#### After import sympy, execute below:
>>> x = Symbol('x')
>>> limit(sin(x)/x, x, 0)
1
>>> integrate(1/x, x)
log(x)

### SymPy Introductory Tutorial

## 04-01 Defining Symbols and Symbolic Operations

### Symbols form the building blocks of symbolic math (符号数学).

### Define single symbol

#### from sympy import Symbol
x = Symbol('x')

### Define multiple symbols

#### from sympy import symbols
x,y,z = symbols('x,y,z')
 
SymPy automatically simplifies only themost basic of expressions and leaves it to the programmer to explicitly require simplification in cases such as the one e.g. (x+2)*(x-3)

 
If you want to multiply out the expression to get the expanded version, you'll have to use theexpand()  function


## 04-02 Working with Expressions

# 05 Playing with Sets and Probability

- We will start by learning how we can make our programs understand and manipulate sets of numbers.
- We'll see how sets can help us understand basic concepts in probability.
- We'll learn about generating random numbers to simulate random events.


## 05-01 What's a Set?
 
A set is a collection ofdistinct objects, often calledelementsormembers.


#### The set is "well defined", meaning the question "Is a particular object in this collections?" always has a clear Yes or No answer, usually based on a rule or some given criteria.

#### No two members of a set are the same!

A set,t, is said to be asuperset  of another set,s, ift  contains all of the members contained ins. --> is_superset()

 
Thepowerset of a set,s, is the set of all possible subsets ofs. --> powerset()


#### Using len() to find set's cardinality.

### Sets allows us to reason about the basic concepts of probability

## 05-02 Probability

### Some Probability Definitions

#### Experiment: is simply the test we want to perform. We perform the test because we are interested in the probability of each possible outcome.

#### Sample Space: all possible outcomes of an experiment form a set known as the sample space, whcih we'll usually call S in our formulas.

#### Event: a set of outcomes that we want to calculate the probability of and that from a subset of the sample space.

#### Uniform Distribution: each outcomes in the sample space is equally likely to occur, formula is P(E) = n(E) / n(S), P(E) is the probability of an event, n(E) is the cardinality of the sets E (event), n(S) is the cardinality of the sets S (sample space)

##### def probability(space, event):
    return len(event)/len(space)
